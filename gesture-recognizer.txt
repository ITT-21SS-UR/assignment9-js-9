 What does the recognizer do?
- It is a recognizer for User Interface Prototypes and can identify unistrokes and multistrokes gestures.
- Gestures are not interpreted as strokes, but as sets of dots called clouds. 
- The used algorithm is low-cost, easy to understand and implement.

Name an advantage of the $P recognizer over the $1 recognizer.
- In contrast to the $1 recogniser, the $P recogniser can recognise unistroke as well as multistroke gestures. 
- Furthermore, due to the interpretation of the gestures as clouds of points, the direction of the strokes and 
  the order of the strokes do not matter in the $P recognisizer. As a result, the different variants of the 
  execution of a gesture can no longer be distinguished due to the missing time component and thus less memory is required.

What is the minimum matching distance?
- TODO
- We define the matching between two point clouds C and T as a function M that associates each point Ci ∈ C with exactly one 
  point Tj ∈ T , Tj = M(Ci ). 
- If C and T have been both resampled4 into the same number of points n, then the matching will also consist of exactly n pairs of points. 
- Inspired by the Euclidean sum of $1 [23] and the Proportional Shape Distance of Shark2 [13], we define the goodness of 
  matching M as the sum of Euclidean distances for all the pairs of points from M
- Assignment Problem represented as a problem from graph theory
- Hungarian algorithm to complex and slow
- heuristics for matching clouds named Greedy
- Greedy-5 performs best
