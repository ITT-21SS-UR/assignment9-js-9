 What does the recognizer do?
- It is a recognizer for User Interface Prototypes and can identify unistrokes and multistrokes gestures.
- Gestures are not interpreted as strokes, but as sets of dots called clouds. 
- The used algorithm is low-cost, easy to understand and implement.

Name an advantage of the $P recognizer over the $1 recognizer.
- In contrast to the $1 recogniser, the $P recogniser can recognise unistroke as well as multistroke gestures. 
- Furthermore, due to the interpretation of the gestures as clouds of points, the direction of the strokes and 
  the order of the strokes do not matter in the $P recognisizer. As a result, the different variants of the 
  execution of a gesture can no longer be distinguished due to the missing time component and thus less memory is required.

#############################################
What is the minimum matching distance?
- Is the matching between two point clouds. In the paper, the goodness of matching M is defined as the sum of the 
  Euclidean distances for all pairs of points from M.
- As heuristic Greedy-5 is used. For each point in the first cloud (Ci ), the nearest point from the second cloud 
  that has not yet been assigned is searched for. The matches are wigthed with confidence valus between 0 and 1 
  to reduce execution time. -> O(n^(2+e))
